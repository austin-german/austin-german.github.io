I am currently a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on Zinacantec Family Homesign ("Z sign"), a sign language developed by three deaf siblings and their hearing extended family members in ZinacantaÃÅn, a Tsotsil Maya community of highland Chiapas, Mexico. I am broadly interested in (i) how social dynamics influence the structure of young sign languages, and (ii) how the quantity of input to which a language learner has access influences language development.

Before coming to UT, I studied Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego.

## What's new?
_Summer 2023_
* I've spent most of the summer preparing two applications for post-doctoral fellowships. I'm also writing chapter for an edited volume and a journal manuscript.
* I will be conducting fieldwork with the Z signers for six weeks in August and September.
* My first sole-authored article has been accepted for publication! It will appear in a special issue of _Diachronica_ on the historical linguistics of sign languages. This work was actually my masters thesis, which I completed in 2021.
* A article co-authored with Laura Horton, Lynn Hou, and Jenny Singleton on language socialization in three indigenous Mesoamerican signing communities has been accepted for publication in _Research on Language and Social Interaction_.
