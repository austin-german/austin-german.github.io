## About me
I am currently a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin.  My research focuses on Zinacantec Family Homesign ("Z sign"), a signed language developed by three deaf siblings and their hearing extended family members in ZinacantaÃÅn, a Tsotsil Maya community of highland Chiapas, Mexico. I am broadly interested in (i) the relationship between community structure and language structure, i.e. how the social dynamics of signing communities influence the grammatical structure of signed languages; and (ii) how variation in the learning environment (e.g., how many language models are available to a learner) influences an individual's language development. The broader goal of my research is to advocate for language access for deaf children.

Before coming to UT, I studied Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. It was at UCSD that I became fascinated with the complex interactions of language, cognition, and experience.
