## About me
I am currently a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin.  My research focuses on Zinacantec Family Homesign ("Z sign"), a signed language developed by three deaf siblings and their hearing extended family members in ZinacantaÃÅn, a Tsotsil Maya community of highland Chiapas, Mexico. I am broadly interested in (i) the relationship between community structure and language structure, i.e. how the social dynamics of signing communities influence the grammatical structure of signed languages; and (ii) how variation in the learning environment (e.g., how many language models are available to a learner) influences an individual's language development.

Before coming to UT, I studied Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. It was at UCSD that I became fascinated with the complex interactions of language, cognition, and experience.

## What's new?
_Summer 2023_
* After spending all of May through July working on two applications for post-doctoral fellowships, a chapter for an edited volume, and a journal manuscript (_none of which are finished..._), I'm finally escaping the scorching Texas heat to go visit the Z signers for six weeks in August and September. I've been warned that the newest member of the family, who I remember as a five-month-old, is now able to run around and tear up the house as a toddling almost-two-year-old. I have no doubt he'll have a cameo in virtually every elicitation session.
  
* My first sole-authored article has been accepted for publication! It will appear in a special issue of _Diachronica_ on the historical linguistics of sign languages. This work formed the basis of my master's thesis, which I completed in 2021.
  
* An article co-authored with profs. Laura Horton, Lynn Hou, and Jenny Singleton on language socialization in three indigenous Mesoamerican signing communities has been accepted for publication in _Research on Language and Social Interaction_. I'm thrilled to finally have this comparative paper published! My own contribution to this paper grew out of some research assistant work I completed for John Haviland at UCSD way back in 2016-2017.
