I am currently a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on Zinacantec Family Homesign, a sign language developed by three deaf siblings and their hearing extended family members in ZinacantaÃÅn, a Tsotsil Maya community of highland Chiapas, Mexico. I am broadly interested in (i) how social dynamics influence the structure of young sign languages, and (ii) how the quantity of input to which a language learner has access influences language development.

Before coming to UT, I studied Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego.
