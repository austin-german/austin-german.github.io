I am currently a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on Zinacantec Family Homesign, a sign language developed by three deaf siblings and their hearing extended family members in ZinacantaÃÅn, a Tsotsil Maya community of highland Chiapas, Mexico. My dissertation work is funded by [NSF BCS #2141436](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2141436&HistoricalAwards=false).
